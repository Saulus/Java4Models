- German codes 

 ICD10-GM [DIMDI] -> ICD10-CM [NCHS], both based on ICD10-WHO
 ATC --> RXNORM (GS-brand, SNOMEDCT, CVX, Dorland)
 OPS --> ICD-10-PCS (SNOMEDCT, Dorland)




Issues:
- Ambiguous design
-- disease hierarchy unclear, e.g. "Diabetes mellitus" (mapped to E10 + E11) vs. "Diabetes mellitus type 2" (mapped to E11)
-- -> Is this meant to be a hierarchy?
-- -> Are relationships passed on to sub-concept? (some relationships are defined for both; some are defined only for diabetes, although they medically apply also to type 2)
-- Coding guide?
-- -> definitions of concepts, e.g. disease vs. symptom?
-- -> how to choose? 
-- -> Example: "renal disease" (= disease, mapped to N08) vs. "end stage renal disease" (=symptom, not mapped)
-- Validation and QS process to enforce guide resp. refactoring to solve ambiguities?  

- Ambiguous for our purpose due to real world
-- concept assignment: an ICD code might map to multiple concepts (diseases, symptoms, clinical findings...)
-- -> which one to choose? Syntactical problem!
-- -> might be distinguished by "mappingQuality" (exactMatch vs. narrowMatch)
-- relationship assignment: a concept (drug, symptom) might have relationships with multiple other concepts (diseases)
-- -> which one to choose? Semantical problem (thinking like the physician)!
